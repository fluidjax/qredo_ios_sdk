General Notes on compiling the QredoXDK framework - 6/9/16


INSTALL
-------

    PreRequisites
        OSX         (tested with 10.11.6)
        Cocoapods   (tested with 1.0.0)
        XCode       (tested with 7.3.1)


    1) run "pod install" from base directory, example output:-
            Analyzing dependencies
            Fetching podspec for `QredoXDK` from `QredoXDK.framework.podspec`
            Pre-downloading: `ios-ntp` from `https://github.com/qredo/SSL-NTP-Time-Sync`
            Downloading dependencies
            Installing CocoaAsyncSocket (7.4.3)
            Installing OpenSSL (1.0.208)
            Installing QredoXDK (0.99)
            Installing ios-ntp (1.1.3)
            Installing jetfire (0.1.5)
            Installing libsodium (1.0.3)

        First time this takes several minutes to build. (it probably hasn't crashed its OpenSSL building from source)

    2) Open QredoSDK.xcworkspace

        Schemes
        -------
        LinguaFrancaTest    - Testing code
        QredoCryptoTests    - Testing code
        QredoSDKTests       - Testing code
        QredoXDK            - Main SDK code
        QredoXDK_Universal  - Gnerates framework files from QredoXDK

    3) To Generate the QredoXDK framework, set the scheme to QredoXDK_Universal and build.







The Main Project Target is QredoXDK
-----------------------------------
There should be no warnings/errors for the Qredo code
There are 28 warnings from libsodium which look something like this (these can be safely ignored, there appears to be no way to add an option to force the ignore of these warnings,
it appears to be an error in the libsodium podspec)
Warning: Multiple build commands for output file ..../Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/libsodium/api.h

To build the framework
The Framework is built using Target QredoXDK_Universal, this places the generated QredoXDK.framework file in the main QredoSDK directory
