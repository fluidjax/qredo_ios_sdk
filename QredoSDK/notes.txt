        QredoCryptTests




The Main Project Target is QredoXDK
-----------------------------------
    There should be no warnings/errors for the Qredo code
    There are 28 warnings from libsodium which look something like this (these can be safely ignored)
        Warning: Multiple build commands for output file ..../Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/libsodium/api.h

    The Framework is built using Target QredoXDK_Universal, this places the generated QredoXDK.framework file in the main QredoSDK directory
