General Notes on compiling the QredoXDK framework - 1/9/16

Code compiles and is tested under
---------------------------------
    XCode 7.3.1
    OSX 10.11.6
    Cocoapods   1.0.0

Pre-requisites
--------------
    Cocoapods
    run "pod install" from base directory
            Analyzing dependencies
            Fetching podspec for `QredoXDK` from `QredoXDK.framework.podspec`
            Pre-downloading: `ios-ntp` from `https://github.com/qredo/SSL-NTP-Time-Sync`
            Downloading dependencies
            Installing CocoaAsyncSocket (7.4.3)
            Installing OpenSSL (1.0.208)
            Installing QredoXDK (0.99)
            Installing ios-ntp (1.1.3)
            Installing jetfire (0.1.5)
            Installing libsodium (1.0.3)

    First time this takes several minutes to build.

            QredoCryptTests




The Main Project Target is QredoXDK
-----------------------------------
    There should be no warnings/errors for the Qredo code
    There are 28 warnings from libsodium which look something like this (these can be safely ignored)
        Warning: Multiple build commands for output file ..../Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/libsodium/api.h

    To build the framework
    The Framework is built using Target QredoXDK_Universal, this places the generated QredoXDK.framework file in the main QredoSDK directory
