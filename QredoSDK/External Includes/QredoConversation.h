 Represents a secure channel of communication between two app users
 
 Objects of this class are never created directly, but returned by the Qredo SDK as a result of:
 
 - responding to a Rendezvous by calling [respondWithTag](QredoClient.html#/c:objc(cs)QredoClient(im)respondWithTag:completionHandler:)
 - enumerating the list of Conversations that the current user is a party to by calling [enumerateConversationsWithBlock](QredoClient.html#/c:objc(cs)QredoClient(im)enumerateConversationsWithBlock:completionHandler:)
 
 @note When a Conversation is established between two parties, as a result of one user responding to a Rendezvous, a Diffie-Hellman key exchange takes place between the creator and the responder. These keys are randomly generated and used to derive a further set of keys that are used to encrypt messages in such a way that only the two parties in the Conversation are able to read the messages.
 All of this is handled behind the scenes by the Qredo SDK, but you can use the fingerprints of the public keys to authenticate the Conversation and ensure that there has not been a 'man-in-the-middle' attack. See the [Authenticating a Conversation](#/Authenticating%20a%20Conversation) methods later in this section.
