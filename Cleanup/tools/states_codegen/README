Generates Objective C code from a sequence diagrams written in DOT-syntax.

Works with naming conventions used in docs/attestation/AuthenticationSession.dot

To run:
python states_codegen.py ../../docs/attestation/AuthenticationSession.dot

The tool requires pydot library whcih can be installed by running:
pip install pydot


DISCLAIMER: My python code must be horrible because it is my first attempt to write in Python.
            If you have time and desire, please feel free to improve it :)
