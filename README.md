* Use QredoClientOptions with more explicit options instead of NSDictionary for authorising QredoClient.
* In BLERendezvous, rendezvous tags advertised as URI. (This ensures compatibility with the Android implementation.)

* Added samples for creating and responding to rendezvous with QR code and BLE
* Added error handling for SDKExamples sample code
* Fixed samples to be compatible with Xcode 6.1.1
