General Notes on compiling the QredoXDK framework - 6/9/16


INSTALL
-------

    PreRequisites
        OSX         (tested with 10.11.6)
        XCode       (tested with 7.3.1)
        Cocoapods   (tested with 1.0.0)
                    sudo gem install activesupport -v 4.2.6
                    sudo gem install cocoapods


    1)  Run "pod install" from base directory.
        The first time this takes several (5-10) minutes to build.  (it probably hasn't crashed its OpenSSL building from source)

    2)  Open QredoSDK.xcworkspace
    3)  For the "QredoXDK" Target set Team/Provisioning Profile for your own account.
    4)  To Generate the QredoXDK framework, set the scheme to "QredoXDK_Universal" and build. (takes a few minutes)
    5)  The framwork file is copied into the project's 'base directory, and is named "QredoXDK.framework"
            This framework provides the full Qredo service and can be included in the tutorial project by dragging it into "Embeded Binaries"






The Main Project Target is QredoXDK
-----------------------------------
There should be no warnings/errors for the Qredo code
There are 28 warnings from libsodium which look something like this (these can be safely ignored, there appears to be no way to add an option to force the ignore of these warnings,
it appears to be an error in the libsodium podspec)
Warning: Multiple build commands for output file ..../Build/Products/Debug-iphonesimulator/libsodium/api.h

To build the framework
The Framework is built using Target QredoXDK_Universal, this places the generated QredoXDK.framework file in the main QredoSDK directory
