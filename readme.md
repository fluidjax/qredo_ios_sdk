####Tutorials

You can find the step by step tutorial instructions on our website for 
[iOS (Swift)] (https://qredo.com/docs/ios/swift/tutorials/) and [iOS  (Objective-C)] (https://qredo.com/docs/ios/objective-c/tutorials/)

While you don’t have to work through each tutorial step by step, and completed versions of each app are included in the tutorials folder in the release repository, we do recommend at least reading through each tutorial.

• *Your First Qredo App*
This tutorial explains how to create a project that uses the Qredo APIs, the important classes and methods you use to connect to the service, and how to write to and read from the Qredo Vault. 

• *Rendezvous/Conversation*
This tutorial shows how to implement secure messaging using Rendezvous and Conversation. It shows how to create and respond to a rendezvous and how to send messages in a secure Conversation.

####Sample apps

The SDK includes *QatChat*, a messaging app, *QatPics* which demonstrates the Vault, *CustomerLookup* which shows how to retrieve items using metadata and *QRCodeRendezvous* and *BLERendezvous*, which demonstrate how to publish a Rendezvous in a QR code or BLE beacon respectively. *iOSEpiq*, a simple word game is also included. For more details on building the examples, see either language version of the *Qredo iOS Programming Guide.*
