##Qredo SDK API Reference

[Documentation Home](https://qredo.com/documentation/)

This reference includes all the classes and methods available to developers using the Qredo iOS SDK. Navigate through the SDK using the list of classes on the left hand side. 

The API documentation is provided in both Objective-C and Swift. with links to the relevant sections of the programming guides that provide more information and include code snippets. 

####Programming guides

Here you can find more information about the core Qredo concepts of Vault, Rendezvous and Conversation, code snippets and coding guidelines.

- [Qredo iOS Programming Guide for Swift] (https://docs.qredo.com/ios/swift/programming_guide/html/index.html)


####Tutorials

You can find the step by step tutorial instructions on our website with code in both Swift and Objective-C.

Completed versions of each tutorial app are included in the tutorials folder in the release archive. We recommend at least reading through each tutorial to introduce you to the core functionality of the Qredo SDK.

• *Your First Qredo App*
[Swift](https://docs.qredo.com/ios/swift/tutorials/your_first_qredo_app/html/index.html), [Objective-C](https://docs.qredo.com/ios/objective-c/tutorials/your_first_qredo_app/html/index.html)

This tutorial explains how to create a project that uses the Qredo APIs, the important classes and methods you use to connect to the service, and how to write to and read from the Qredo Vault. 


• *Rendezvous/Conversation* [Swift](https://docs.qredo.com/ios/swift/tutorials/rendezvous/html/index.html), [Objective-C](https://docs.qredo.com/ios/objective-c/tutorials/rendezvous/html/index.html)

This tutorial shows how to implement secure messaging using Rendezvous and Conversation. It shows how to create and respond to a rendezvous and how to send messages in a secure Conversation.

####Sample apps

The SDK includes *QatChat*, a messaging app, *QatPics* which demonstrates the Vault, *CustomerLookup* which shows how to retrieve items using metadata and *QRCodeRendezvous* and *BLERendezvous*, which demonstrate how to publish a Rendezvous in a QR code or BLE beacon respectively. 

Also included is *Epiq*, a word game for 1 or 2 players that demonstrates Vault, Rendezvous and Conversation and shows how to publish Rendezvous tags using QR Codes and Messages. Epiq is a great place to start getting ideas for your own apps.

For more details on building the examples, see either language version of the *Qredo iOS Programming Guide.*
